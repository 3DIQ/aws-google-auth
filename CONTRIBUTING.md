# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! The most valuable contributions, in order of preference, are:

1. Pull requests (whether adding a feature, improving an existing feature, or fixing a bug)
1. Opening an issue (bug reports or feature requests)
1. Fork, star, watch, or share this project on your social networks.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are definitely welcome. In order to be most useful, please try and make sure that:

* the pull request has a clear description of what it's for (new feature, enhancement, or bug fix)
* the code is clean and understandable
* the pull request would merge cleanly

## Issues

Issues are also very welcome! Please try and make sure that:

* bug reports include stack traces, copied and pasted from your terminal
* feature requests include a clear description of _why_ you want that feature, not just what you want
